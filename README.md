The Agony Forge is a modern, web based MUD core. It is [MIT licensed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scionaltera/agony-forge-core/master/LICENSE) so you can use it for anything you want, free or commercial.

The Core is a library with all the basic elements you would need to create a web based MUD. You can't run it by itself, but you can fork the [demo project](https://github.com/scionaltera/agony-forge-demo) and use that to get your own MUD started.

Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/scionaltera/agony-forge-core/wiki) for details about how to use the Agony Forge.
